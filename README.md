Movie Sagas Application Challenge

## Description

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a database of movie data, pulling that movie data from the database, and displaying it on the DOM. The application needed to have a movie list page, a movie details page, and an edit page. When the user selects a movie on the movie list homepage, they are taken to a movie details page that displays all of the details for that particular movie. The user can then either return to the homepage, or click the edit button to edit the title or description of the movie. Upon clicking edit, the user is taken to the edit page that contains two input fields. One is for the title and the other is for editing the description. Both of the input fields auto-populate with the selected movie data so that the user can easily swap in or swap out just the details they want to change without having to retype all of the data entirely. When the user clicks the Save button, a PUT route is made to update the database accordingly for that particular movie and the user is taken back to the home page to see the updated movie.
